<p>Of English blood, of Tuscan birth,</p>
<p class='indent2'>What country should we give her?</p>
<p>Instead of any on the earth,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The civic Heavens receive her.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>II.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And here among the English tombs</p>
<p class='indent2'>In Tuscan ground we lay her,</p>
<p>While the blue Tuscan sky endomes</p>
<p class='indent2'>Our English words of prayer.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p class='center'>III.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>A little child!&mdash;how long she lived,</p>
<p class='indent2'>By months, not years, is reckoned:</p>
<p>Born in one July, she survived</p>
<p class='indent2'>Alone to see a second.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>IV.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Bright-featured, as the July sun</p>
<p class='indent2'>Her little face still played in,</p>
<p>And splendours, with her birth begun,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Had had no time for fading.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>V.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>So, <span class='smcap'>Lily</span>, from those July hours,</p>
<p class='indent2'>No wonder we should call her;</p>
<p>She looked such kinship to the flowers,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Was but a little taller.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>VI.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>A Tuscan Lily,&mdash;only white,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As Dante, in abhorrence</p>
<p>Of red corruption, wished aright</p>
<p class='indent2'>The lilies of his Florence.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p class='center'>VII.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>We could not wish her whiter,&mdash;her</p>
<p class='indent2'>Who perfumed with pure blossom</p>
<p>The house&mdash;a lovely thing to wear</p>
<p class='indent2'>Upon a mother&rsquo;s bosom!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>VIII.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>This July creature thought perhaps</p>
<p class='indent2'>Our speech not worth assuming;</p>
<p>She sat upon her parents&rsquo; laps</p>
<p class='indent2'>And mimicked the gnat&rsquo;s humming;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>IX.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Said &ldquo;father,&rdquo; &ldquo;mother&rdquo;&mdash;then left off,</p>
<p class='indent2'>For tongues celestial, fitter:</p>
<p>Her hair had grown just long enough</p>
<p class='indent2'>To catch heaven&rsquo;s jasper-glitter.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>X.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Babes! Love could always hear and see</p>
<p class='indent2'>Behind the cloud that hid them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let little children come to Me,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And do not thou forbid them.&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p class='center'>XI.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>So, unforbidding, have we met,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And gently here have laid her,</p>
<p>Though winter is no time to get</p>
<p class='indent2'>The flowers that should o&rsquo;erspread her:</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XII.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>We should bring pansies quick with spring,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Rose, violet, daffodilly,</p>
<p>And also, above everything,</p>
<p class='indent2'>White lilies for our Lily.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XIII.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Nay, more than flowers, this grave exacts,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Glad, grateful attestations</p>
<p>Of her sweet eyes and pretty acts,</p>
<p class='indent2'>With calm renunciations.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XIV.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Her very mother with light feet</p>
<p class='indent2'>Should leave the place too earthy,</p>
<p>Saying &ldquo;The angels have thee, Sweet,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Because we are not worthy.&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p class='center'>XV.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>But winter kills the orange-buds,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The gardens in the frost are,</p>
<p>And all the heart dissolves in floods,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Remembering we have lost her.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XVI.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Poor earth, poor heart,&mdash;too weak, too weak</p>
<p class='indent2'>To miss the July shining!</p>
<p>Poor heart!&mdash;what bitter words we speak</p>
<p class='indent2'>When God speaks of resigning!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XVII.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Sustain this heart in us that faints,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Thou God, the self-existent!</p>
<p>We catch up wild at parting saints</p>
<p class='indent2'>And feel Thy heaven too distant.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XVIII.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>The wind that swept them out of sin</p>
<p class='indent2'>Has ruffled all our vesture:</p>
<p>On the shut door that let them in</p>
<p class='indent2'>We beat with frantic gesture,&mdash;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p class='center'>XIX.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>To us, us also, open straight!</p>
<p class='indent2'>The outer life is chilly;</p>
<p>Are <i>we</i> too, like the earth, to wait</p>
<p class='indent2'>Till next year for our Lily?</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XX.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&mdash;Oh, my own baby on my knees,</p>
<p class='indent2'>My leaping, dimpled treasure,</p>
<p>At every word I write like these,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Clasped close with stronger pressure!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XXI.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Too well my own heart understands,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>At every word beats fuller&mdash;</p>
<p>My little feet, my little hands,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And hair of Lily&rsquo;s colour!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>XXII.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>But God gives patience, Love learns strength,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And Faith remembers promise,</p>
<p>And Hope itself can smile at length</p>
<p class='indent2'>On other hopes gone from us.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<p>Love, strong as Death, shall conquer Death,</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Arms, empty of her child, she lifts</p>

<p>That thou wast in the world a year ago,</p>
<p>What time I sat alone here in the snow</p>
<p>And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink</p>
<p>No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,</p>
<p>Went counting all my chains as if that so</p>
<p>They never could fall off at any blow</p>
<p>Struck by thy possible hand,&mdash;why, thus I drink</p>
<p>Of life&rsquo;s great cup of wonder! Wonderful,</p>
<p>Never to feel thee thrill the day or night</p>
<p>With personal act or speech,&mdash;nor ever cull</p>
<p>Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white</p>
<p>Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull,</p>
<p>Who cannot guess God&rsquo;s presence out of sight.</p>

<p>This poem contains the impressions of the writer upon
events in Tuscany of which she was a witness. &ldquo;From a
window,&rdquo; the critic may demur. She bows to the objection
in the very title of her work. No continuous narrative nor
exposition of political philosophy is attempted by her. It is
a simple story of personal impressions, whose only value is
in the intensity with which they were received, as proving
her warm affection for a beautiful and unfortunate country,
and the sincerity with which they are related, as indicating
her own good faith and freedom from partisanship.</p>
<p>Of the two parts of this poem, the first was written
nearly three years ago, while the second resumes the actual
situation of 1851. The discrepancy between the two parts
is a sufficient guarantee to the public of the truthfulness of
the writer, who, though she certainly escaped the epidemic
&ldquo;falling sickness&rdquo; of enthusiasm for Pio Nono, takes shame
upon herself that she believed, like a woman, some royal
oaths, and lost sight of the probable consequences of some
obvious popular defects. If the discrepancy should be painful
to the reader, let him understand that to the writer it has
been more so. But such discrepancies we are called upon
to accept at every hour by the conditions of our nature,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
implying the interval between aspiration and performance,
between faith and disillusion, between hope and fact.</p>

<p>I heard last night a little child go singing</p>
<p class='indent2'>&rsquo;Neath Casa Guidi windows, by the church,</p>
<p><i>O bella libertà, O bella!</i>&mdash;stringing</p>
<p class='indent2'>The same words still on notes he went in search</p>
<p>So high for, you concluded the upspringing</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of such a nimble bird to sky from perch</p>
<p>Must leave the whole bush in a tremble green,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And that the heart of Italy must beat,</p>
<p>While such a voice had leave to rise serene</p>
<p class='indent2'>&rsquo;Twixt church and palace of a Florence street:</p>
<p>A little child, too, who not long had been</p>
<p class='indent2'>By mother&rsquo;s finger steadied on his feet,</p>
<p>And still <i>O bella libertà</i> he sang.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Then I thought, musing, of the innumerous</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sweet songs which still for Italy outrang</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>From older singers&rsquo; lips who sang not thus</p>
<p class='indent2'>Exultingly and purely, yet, with pang</p>
<p>Fast sheathed in music, touched the heart of us</p>
<p class='indent2'>So finely that the pity scarcely pained.</p>
<p>I thought how Filicaja led on others,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Bewailers for their Italy enchained,</p>
<p>And how they called her childless among mothers,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Widow of empires, ay, and scarce refrained</p>
<p>Cursing her beauty to her face, as brothers</p>
<p class='indent2'>Might a shamed sister&rsquo;s,&mdash;&ldquo;Had she been less fair</p>
<p>She were less wretched;&rdquo;&mdash;how, evoking so</p>
<p class='indent2'>From congregated wrong and heaped despair</p>
<p>Of men and women writhing under blow,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Harrowed and hideous in a filthy lair,</p>
<p>Some personating Image wherein woe</p>
<p class='indent2'>Was wrapt in beauty from offending much,</p>
<p>They called it Cybele, or Niobe,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Or laid it corpse-like on a bier for such,</p>
<p>Where all the world might drop for Italy</p>
<p class='indent2'>Those cadenced tears which burn not where they touch,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juliet of nations, canst thou die as we?</p>
<p class='indent2'>And was the violet crown that crowned thy head</p>
<p>So over-large, though new buds made it rough,</p>
<p class='indent2'>It slipped down and across thine eyelids dead,</p>
<p>O sweet, fair Juliet?&rdquo; Of such songs enough,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Too many of such complaints! behold, instead,</p>

<p class='indent2'>As void as that is, are all images</p>
<p>Men set between themselves and actual wrong,</p>
<p class='indent2'>To catch the weight of pity, meet the stress</p>
<p>Of conscience,&mdash;since &rsquo;t is easier to gaze long</p>
<p class='indent2'>On mournful masks and sad effigies</p>
<p>Than on real, live, weak creatures crushed by strong.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>For me who stand in Italy to-day</p>
<p>Where worthier poets stood and sang before,</p>
<p class='indent2'>I kiss their footsteps yet their words gainsay.</p>
<p>I can but muse in hope upon this shore</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of golden Arno as it shoots away</p>
<p>Through Florence&rsquo; heart beneath her bridges four:</p>
<p class='indent2'>Bent bridges, seeming to strain off like bows,</p>
<p>And tremble while the arrowy undertide</p>
<p class='indent2'>Shoots on and cleaves the marble as it goes,</p>
<p>And strikes up palace-walls on either side,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And froths the cornice out in glittering rows,</p>
<p>With doors and windows quaintly multiplied,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And terrace-sweeps, and gazers upon all,</p>
<p>By whom if flower or kerchief were thrown out</p>
<p class='indent2'>From any lattice there, the same would fall</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>Into the river underneath, no doubt,</p>
<p class='indent2'>It runs so close and fast &rsquo;twixt wall and wall.</p>
<p>How beautiful! the mountains from without</p>
<p class='indent2'>In silence listen for the word said next.</p>
<p>What word will men say,&mdash;here where Giotto planted</p>
<p class='indent2'>His campanile like an unperplexed</p>
<p>Fine question Heavenward, touching the things granted</p>
<p class='indent2'>A noble people who, being greatly vexed</p>
<p>In act, in aspiration keep undaunted?</p>

<p class='indent2'>Like dogs upon a dunghill, couched on clay</p>
<p>From whence the Medicean stamp&rsquo;s outworn,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The final putting off of all such sway</p>

<p class='indent2'>In Florence and the great world outside Florence.</p>
<p>Three hundred years his patient statues wait</p>
<p class='indent2'>In that small chapel of the dim Saint Lawrence:</p>

<p>On darkness and with level looks meet fate,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>When once loose from that marble film of theirs;</p>
<p>The Night has wild dreams in her sleep, the Dawn</p>
<p class='indent2'>Is haggard as the sleepless, Twilight wears</p>
<p>A sort of horror; as the veil withdrawn</p>
<p class='indent2'>&rsquo;Twixt the artist&rsquo;s soul and works had left them heirs</p>
<p>Of speechless thoughts which would not quail nor fawn,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of angers and contempts, of hope and love:</p>
<p>For not without a meaning did he place</p>
<p class='indent2'>The princely Urbino on the seat above</p>
<p>With everlasting shadow on his face,</p>
<p class='indent2'>While the slow dawns and twilights disapprove</p>
<p>The ashes of his long-extinguished race</p>
<p class='indent2'>Which never more shall clog the feet of men.</p>
<p>I do believe, divinest Angelo,</p>
<p class='indent2'>That winter-hour in Via Larga, when</p>
<p>They bade thee build a statue up in snow<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
<p class='indent2'>And straight that marvel of thine art again</p>
<p>Dissolved beneath the sun&rsquo;s Italian glow,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Thine eyes, dilated with the plastic passion,</p>
<p>Thawing too in drops of wounded manhood, since,</p>
<p class='indent2'>To mock alike thine art and indignation,</p>
<p>Laughed at the palace-window the new prince,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>(&ldquo;Aha! this genius needs for exaltation,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>When all&rsquo;s said and however the proud may wince,</p>
<p class='indent2'>A little marble from our princely mines!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I do believe that hour thou laughedst too</p>
<p class='indent2'>For the whole sad world and for thy Florentines,</p>
<p>After those few tears, which were only few!</p>
<p class='indent2'>That as, beneath the sun, the grand white lines</p>
<p>Of thy snow-statue trembled and withdrew,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>The head, erect as Jove&rsquo;s, being palsied first,</p>
<p>The eyelids flattened, the full brow turned blank,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The right-hand, raised but now as if it cursed,</p>
<p>Dropt, a mere snowball, (till the people sank</p>
<p class='indent2'>Their voices, though a louder laughter burst</p>
<p>From the royal window)&mdash;thou couldst proudly thank</p>
<p class='indent2'>God and the prince for promise and presage,</p>
<p>And laugh the laugh back, I think verily,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Thine eyes being purged by tears of righteous rage</p>
<p>To read a wrong into a prophecy,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And measure a true great man&rsquo;s heritage</p>
<p>Against a mere great-duke&rsquo;s posterity.</p>
<p class='indent2'>I think thy soul said then, &ldquo;I do not need</p>
<p>A princedom and its quarries, after all;</p>
<p class='indent2'>For if I write, paint, carve a word, indeed,</p>
<p>On book or board or dust, on floor or wall,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The same is kept of God who taketh heed</p>
<p>That not a letter of the meaning fall</p>
<p class='indent2'>Or ere it touch and teach His world&rsquo;s deep heart,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Outlasting, therefore, all your lordships, sir!</p>
<p class='indent2'>So keep your stone, beseech you, for your part,</p>
<p>To cover up your grave-place and refer</p>
<p class='indent2'>The proper titles; <i>I</i> live by my art.</p>
<p>The thought I threw into this snow shall stir</p>
<p class='indent2'>This gazing people when their gaze is done;</p>
<p>And the tradition of your act and mine,</p>
<p class='indent2'>When all the snow is melted in the sun,</p>
<p>Shall gather up, for unborn men, a sign</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of what is the true princedom,&mdash;ay, and none</p>
<p>Shall laugh that day, except the drunk with wine.&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Amen, great Angelo! the day&rsquo;s at hand.</p>
<p>If many laugh not on it, shall we weep?</p>
<p class='indent2'>Much more we must not, let us understand.</p>
<p>Through rhymers sonneteering in their sleep</p>
<p class='indent2'>And archaists mumbling dry bones up the land</p>
<p>And sketchers lauding ruined towns a-heap,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Through all that drowsy hum of voices smooth,</p>
<p>The hopeful bird mounts carolling from brake,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The hopeful child, with leaps to catch his growth,</p>
<p>Sings open-eyed for liberty&rsquo;s sweet sake:</p>
<p class='indent2'>And I, a singer also from my youth,</p>
<p>Prefer to sing with these who are awake,</p>
<p class='indent2'>With birds, with babes, with men who will not fear</p>
<p>The baptism of the holy morning dew,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>(And many of such wakers now are here,</p>
<p>Complete in their anointed manhood, who</p>

<p>Than join those old thin voices with my new,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And sigh for Italy with some safe sigh</p>
<p>Cooped up in music &rsquo;twixt an oh and ah,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Nay, hand in hand with that young child, will I</p>
<p>Go singing rather, &ldquo;<i>Bella libertà</i>,&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Than, with those poets, croon the dead or cry</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se tu men bella fossi, Italia!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;Less wretched if less fair.&rdquo; Perhaps a truth</p>
<p>Is so far plain in this, that Italy,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Long trammelled with the purple of her youth</p>
<p>Against her age&rsquo;s ripe activity,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sits still upon her tombs, without death&rsquo;s ruth</p>
<p>But also without life&rsquo;s brave energy.</p>

<p class='indent2'>The paints with fire of souls electrical,</p>
<p>Or broke up heaven for music. What more then?</p>
<p class='indent2'>Why, then, no more. The chaplet&rsquo;s last beads fall</p>
<p>In naming the last saintship within ken,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And, after that, none prayeth in the land.</p>
<p>Alas, this Italy has too long swept</p>
<p class='indent2'>Heroic ashes up for hour-glass sand;</p>
<p>Of her own past, impassioned nympholept!</p>
<p class='indent2'>Consenting to be nailed here by the hand</p>
<p>To the very bay-tree under which she stept</p>
<p class='indent2'>A queen of old, and plucked a leafy branch;</p>
<p>And, licensing the world too long indeed</p>
<p class='indent2'>To use her broad phylacteries to staunch</p>
<p>And stop her bloody lips, she takes no heed</p>
<p class='indent2'>How one clear word would draw an avalanche</p>
<p>Of living sons around her, to succeed</p>
<p class='indent2'>The vanished generations. Can she count</p>
<p>These oil-eaters with large live mobile mouths</p>
<p class='indent2'>Agape for macaroni, in the amount</p>
<p>Of consecrated heroes of her south&rsquo;s</p>
<p class='indent2'>Bright rosary? The pitcher at the fount,</p>
<p>The gift of gods, being broken, she much loathes</p>
<p class='indent2'>To let the ground-leaves of the place confer</p>
<p>A natural bowl. So henceforth she would seem</p>
<p class='indent2'>No nation, but the poet&rsquo;s pensioner,</p>
<p>With alms from every land of song and dream,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>While aye her pipers sadly pipe of her</p>
<p>Until their proper breaths, in that extreme</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of sighing, split the reed on which they played:</p>
<p>Of which, no more. But never say &ldquo;no more&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent2'>To Italy&rsquo;s life! Her memories undismayed</p>
<p>Still argue &ldquo;evermore;&rdquo; her graves implore</p>
<p class='indent2'>Her future to be strong and not afraid;</p>
<p>Her very statues send their looks before.</p>

<p>Ere Luther came to spill them, swore they stank;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Who also by a princely deathbed cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loose Florence, or God will not loose thy soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Then fell back the Magnificent and died</p>
<p>Beneath the star-look shooting from the cowl,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Which turned to wormwood-bitterness the wide</p>
<p>Deep sea of his ambitions. It were foul</p>
<p class='indent2'>To grudge Savonarola and the rest</p>
<p>Their violets: rather pay them quick and fresh!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>The emphasis of death makes manifest</p>
<p>The eloquence of action in our flesh;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And men who, living, were but dimly guessed,</p>
<p>When once free from their life&rsquo;s entangled mesh,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Show their full length in graves, or oft indeed</p>
<p>Exaggerate their stature, in the flat,</p>
<p class='indent2'>To noble admirations which exceed</p>
<p>Most nobly, yet will calculate in that</p>
<p class='indent2'>But accurately. We, who are the seed</p>
<p>Of buried creatures, if we turned and spat</p>
<p class='indent2'>Upon our antecedents, we were vile.</p>
<p>Bring violets rather. If these had not walked</p>
<p class='indent2'>Their furlong, could we hope to walk our mile?</p>
<p>Therefore bring violets. Yet if we self-baulked</p>
<p class='indent2'>Stand still, a-strewing violets all the while,</p>
<p>These moved in vain, of whom we have vainly talked.</p>
<p class='indent2'>So rise up henceforth with a cheerful smile,</p>
<p>And having strewn the violets, reap the corn,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And having reaped and garnered, bring the plough</p>
<p>And draw new furrows &rsquo;neath the healthy morn,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And plant the great Hereafter in this Now.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Of old &rsquo;t was so. How step by step was worn,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As each man gained on each securely!&mdash;how</p>
<p>Each by his own strength sought his own Ideal,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>The ultimate Perfection leaning bright</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>From out the sun and stars to bless the leal</p>
<p class='indent2'>And earnest search of all for Fair and Right</p>
<p>Through doubtful forms by earth accounted real!</p>
<p class='indent2'>Because old Jubal blew into delight</p>
<p>The souls of men with clear-piped melodies,</p>
<p class='indent2'>If youthful Asaph were content at most</p>
<p>To draw from Jubal&rsquo;s grave, with listening eyes,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Traditionary music&rsquo;s floating ghost</p>
<p>Into the grass-grown silence, were it wise?</p>
<p class='indent2'>And was &rsquo;t not wiser, Jubal&rsquo;s breath being lost,</p>
<p>That Miriam clashed her cymbals to surprise</p>
<p class='indent2'>The sun between her white arms flung apart,</p>
<p>With new glad golden sounds? that David&rsquo;s strings</p>
<p class='indent2'>O&rsquo;erflowed his hand with music from his heart?</p>
<p>So harmony grows full from many springs,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And happy accident turns holy art.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>You enter, in your Florence wanderings,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The church of Saint Maria Novella. Pass</p>
<p>The left stair, where at plague-time Machiavel<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a></p>
<p class='indent2'>Saw One with set fair face as in a glass,</p>
<p>Dressed out against the fear of death and hell,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Rustling her silks in pauses of the mass,</p>
<p>To keep the thought off how her husband fell,</p>
<p class='indent2'>When she left home, stark dead across her feet,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>The stair leads up to what the Orgagnas save</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of Dante&rsquo;s d&aelig;mons; you, in passing it,</p>
<p>Ascend the right stair from the farther nave</p>
<p class='indent2'>To muse in a small chapel scarcely lit</p>
<p>By Cimabue&rsquo;s Virgin. Bright and brave,</p>
<p class='indent2'>That picture was accounted, mark, of old:</p>
<p>A king stood bare before its sovran grace,<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a></p>
<p class='indent2'>A reverent people shouted to behold</p>
<p>The picture, not the king, and even the place</p>
<p class='indent2'>Containing such a miracle grew bold,</p>
<p>Named the Glad Borgo from that beauteous face</p>
<p class='indent2'>Which thrilled the artist, after work, to think</p>
<p>His own ideal Mary-smile should stand</p>
<p class='indent2'>So very near him,&mdash;he, within the brink</p>
<p>Of all that glory, let in by his hand</p>
<p class='indent2'>With too divine a rashness! Yet none shrink</p>
<p>Who come to gaze here now; albeit &rsquo;t was planned</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sublimely in the thought&rsquo;s simplicity:</p>
<p>The Lady, throned in empyreal state,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Minds only the young Babe upon her knee,</p>
<p>While sidelong angels bear the royal weight,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Prostrated meekly, smiling tenderly</p>
<p>Oblivion of their wings; the Child thereat</p>
<p class='indent2'>Stretching its hand like God. If any should,</p>
<p>Because of some stiff draperies and loose joints,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Gaze scorn down from the heights of Raffaelhood</p>
<p>On Cimabue&rsquo;s picture,&mdash;Heaven anoints</p>
<p class='indent2'>The head of no such critic, and his blood</p>
<p>The poet&rsquo;s curse strikes full on and appoints</p>
<p class='indent2'>To ague and cold spasms for evermore.</p>
<p>A noble picture! worthy of the shout</p>
<p class='indent2'>Wherewith along the streets the people bore</p>
<p>Its cherub-faces which the sun threw out</p>
<p class='indent2'>Until they stooped and entered the church door.</p>
<p>Yet rightly was young Giotto talked about,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Whom Cimabue found among the sheep,<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a></p>
<p>And knew, as gods know gods, and carried home</p>
<p class='indent2'>To paint the things he had painted, with a deep</p>
<p>And fuller insight, and so overcome</p>
<p class='indent2'>His chapel-Lady with a heavenlier sweep</p>
<p>Of light: for thus we mount into the sum</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of great things known or acted. I hold, too,</p>
<p>That Cimabue smiled upon the lad</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>At the first stroke which passed what he could do,</p>
<p>Or else his Virgin&rsquo;s smile had never had</p>
<p class='indent2'>Such sweetness in &rsquo;t. All great men who foreknew</p>
<p>Their heirs in art, for art&rsquo;s sake have been glad,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And bent their old white heads as if uncrowned,</p>
<p>Fanatics of their pure Ideals still</p>
<p class='indent2'>Far more than of their triumphs, which were found</p>
<p>With some less vehement struggle of the will.</p>
<p class='indent2'>If old Margheritone trembled, swooned</p>
<p>And died despairing at the open sill</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of other men&rsquo;s achievements (who achieved,</p>
<p>By loving art beyond the master), he</p>
<p class='indent2'>Was old Margheritone, and conceived</p>
<p>Never, at first youth and most ecstasy,</p>
<p class='indent2'>A Virgin like that dream of one, which heaved</p>
<p>The death-sigh from his heart. If wistfully</p>
<p class='indent2'>Margheritone sickened at the smell</p>
<p>Of Cimabue&rsquo;s laurel, let him go!</p>
<p class='indent2'>For Cimabue stood up very well</p>
<p>In spite of Giotto&rsquo;s, and Angelico</p>
<p class='indent2'>The artist-saint kept smiling in his cell</p>
<p>The smile with which he welcomed the sweet slow</p>
<p class='indent2'>Inbreak of angels (whitening through the dim</p>
<p>That he might paint them), while the sudden sense</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of Raffael&rsquo;s future was revealed to him</p>
<p>By force of his own fair works&rsquo; competence.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>The same blue waters where the dolphins swim</p>
<p>Suggest the tritons. Through the blue Immense</p>
<p class='indent2'>Strike out, all swimmers! cling not in the way</p>
<p>Of one another, so to sink; but learn</p>
<p class='indent2'>The strong man&rsquo;s impulse, catch the freshening spray</p>
<p>He throws up in his motions, and discern</p>
<p class='indent2'>By his clear westering eye, the time of day.</p>
<p>Thou, God, hast set us worthy gifts to earn</p>
<p class='indent2'>Besides Thy heaven and Thee! and when I say</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s room here for the weakest man alive</p>
<p class='indent2'>To live and die, there&rsquo;s room too, I repeat,</p>
<p>For all the strongest to live well, and strive</p>
<p class='indent2'>Their own way, by their individual heat,&mdash;</p>
<p>Like some new bee-swarm leaving the old hive,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Despite the wax which tempts so violet-sweet.</p>
<p>Then let the living live, the dead retain</p>
<p class='indent2'>Their grave-cold flowers!&mdash;though honour&rsquo;s best supplied</p>
<p>By bringing actions, to prove theirs not vain.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>Cold graves, we say? it shall be testified</p>
<p>That living men who burn in heart and brain,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Without the dead were colder. If we tried</p>
<p>To sink the past beneath our feet, be sure</p>
<p class='indent2'>The future would not stand. Precipitate</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>This old roof from the shrine, and, insecure,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The nesting swallows fly off, mate from mate.</p>
<p>How scant the gardens, if the graves were fewer!</p>
<p class='indent2'>The tall green poplars grew no longer straight</p>
<p>Whose tops not looked to Troy. Would any fight</p>
<p class='indent2'>For Athens, and not swear by Marathon?</p>
<p>Who dared build temples, without tombs in sight?</p>
<p class='indent2'>Or live, without some dead man&rsquo;s benison?</p>
<p>Or seek truth, hope for good, and strive for right,</p>
<p class='indent2'>If, looking up, he saw not in the sun</p>
<p>Some angel of the martyrs all day long</p>
<p class='indent2'>Standing and waiting? Your last rhythm will need</p>
<p>Your earliest key-note. Could I sing this song,</p>
<p class='indent2'>If my dead masters had not taken heed</p>
<p>To help the heavens and earth to make me strong,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As the wind ever will find out some reed</p>
<p>And touch it to such issues as belong</p>
<p class='indent2'>To such a frail thing? None may grudge the Dead</p>
<p>Libations from full cups. Unless we choose</p>
<p class='indent2'>To look back to the hills behind us spread,</p>
<p>The plains before us sadden and confuse;</p>
<p class='indent2'>If orphaned, we are disinherited.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>I would but turn these lachrymals to use,</p>

<p class='indent2'>What made my heart beat with exulting love</p>
<p>A few weeks back?&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent20'>The day was such a day</p>
<p class='indent2'>As Florence owes the sun. The sky above,</p>
<p>Its weight upon the mountains seemed to lay,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And palpitate in glory, like a dove</p>
<p>Who has flown too fast, full-hearted&mdash;take away</p>
<p class='indent2'>The image! for the heart of man beat higher</p>
<p>That day in Florence, flooding all her streets</p>
<p class='indent2'>And piazzas with a tumult and desire.</p>
<p>The people, with accumulated heats</p>
<p class='indent2'>And faces turned one way, as if one fire</p>
<p>Both drew and flushed them, left their ancient beats</p>
<p class='indent2'>And went up toward the palace-Pitti wall</p>
<p>To thank their Grand-duke who, not quite of course,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Had graciously permitted, at their call,</p>
<p>The citizens to use their civic force</p>
<p class='indent2'>To guard their civic homes. So, one and all,</p>
<p>The Tuscan cities streamed up to the source</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of this new good at Florence, taking it</p>
<p>As good so far, presageful of more good,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>The first torch of Italian freedom, lit</p>
<p>To toss in the next tiger&rsquo;s face who should</p>
<p class='indent2'>Approach too near them in a greedy fit,&mdash;</p>
<p>The first pulse of an even flow of blood</p>
<p class='indent2'>To prove the level of Italian veins</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>Towards rights perceived and granted. How we gazed</p>
<p class='indent2'>From Casa Guidi windows while, in trains</p>
<p>Of orderly procession&mdash;banners raised,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And intermittent bursts of martial strains</p>
<p>Which died upon the shout, as if amazed</p>
<p class='indent2'>By gladness beyond music&mdash;they passed on!</p>
<p>The Magistracy, with insignia, passed,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And all the people shouted in the sun,</p>
<p>And all the thousand windows which had cast</p>
<p class='indent2'>A ripple of silks in blue and scarlet down</p>
<p>(As if the houses overflowed at last),</p>
<p class='indent2'>Seemed growing larger with fair heads and eyes.</p>
<p>The Lawyers passed,&mdash;and still arose the shout,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And hands broke from the windows to surprise</p>
<p>Those grave calm brows with bay-tree leaves thrown out.</p>
<p class='indent2'>The Priesthood passed,&mdash;the friars with worldly-wise</p>
<p>Keen sidelong glances from their beards about</p>
<p class='indent2'>The street to see who shouted; many a monk</p>
<p>Who takes a long rope in the waist, was there:</p>
<p class='indent2'>Whereat the popular exultation drunk</p>
<p>With indrawn &ldquo;vivas&rdquo; the whole sunny air,</p>
<p class='indent2'>While through the murmuring windows rose and sunk</p>
<p>A cloud of kerchiefed hands,&mdash;&ldquo;The church makes fair</p>
<p class='indent2'>Her welcome in the new Pope&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; Ensued</p>
<p>The black sign of the &ldquo;Martyrs&rdquo;&mdash;(name no name,</p>
<p class='indent2'>But count the graves in silence). Next were viewed</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>The Artists; next, the Trades; and after came</p>
<p class='indent2'>The People,&mdash;flag and sign, and rights as good&mdash;</p>
<p>And very loud the shout was for that same</p>
<p class='indent2'>Motto, &ldquo;Il popolo.&rdquo; <span class='smcap'>Il Popolo</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>The word means dukedom, empire, majesty,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And kings in such an hour might read it so.</p>
<p>And next, with banners, each in his degree,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Deputed representatives a-row</p>
<p>Of every separate state of Tuscany:</p>
<p class='indent2'>Siena&rsquo;s she-wolf, bristling on the fold</p>
<p>Of the first flag, preceded Pisa&rsquo;s hare,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And Massa&rsquo;s lion floated calm in gold,</p>
<p>Pienza&rsquo;s following with his silver stare,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Arezzo&rsquo;s steed pranced clear from bridle-hold,&mdash;</p>
<p>And well might shout our Florence, greeting there</p>
<p class='indent2'>These, and more brethren. Last, the world had sent</p>
<p>The various children of her teeming flanks&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Greeks, English, French&mdash;as if to a parliament</p>
<p>Of lovers of her Italy in ranks,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Each bearing its land&rsquo;s symbol reverent;</p>
<p>At which the stones seemed breaking into thanks</p>
<p class='indent2'>And rattling up the sky, such sounds in proof</p>
<p>Arose; the very house-walls seemed to bend;</p>
<p class='indent2'>The very windows, up from door to roof,</p>
<p>Flashed out a rapture of bright heads, to mend</p>
<p class='indent2'>With passionate looks the gesture&rsquo;s whirling off</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>A hurricane of leaves. Three hours did end</p>
<p class='indent2'>While all these passed; and ever in the crowd,</p>
<p>Rude men, unconscious of the tears that kept</p>
<p class='indent2'>Their beards moist, shouted; some few laughed aloud,</p>
<p>And none asked any why they laughed and wept:</p>
<p class='indent2'>Friends kissed each other&rsquo;s cheeks, and foes long vowed</p>
<p>More warmly did it; two-months&rsquo; babies leapt</p>
<p class='indent2'>Right upward in their mother&rsquo;s arms, whose black</p>
<p>Wide glittering eyes looked elsewhere; lovers pressed</p>
<p class='indent2'>Each before either, neither glancing back;</p>
<p>And peasant maidens smoothly &rsquo;tired and tressed</p>
<p class='indent2'>Forgot to finger on their throats the slack</p>
<p>Great pearl-strings; while old blind men would not rest,</p>
<p class='indent2'>But pattered with their staves and slid their shoes</p>
<p>Along the stones, and smiled as if they saw.</p>
<p class='indent2'>O heaven, I think that day had noble use</p>
<p>Among God&rsquo;s days! So near stood Right and Law,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Both mutually forborne! Law would not bruise</p>
<p>Nor Right deny, and each in reverent awe</p>
<p class='indent2'>Honoured the other. And if, ne&rsquo;ertheless,</p>
<p>That good day&rsquo;s sun delivered to the vines</p>
<p class='indent2'>No charta, and the liberal Duke&rsquo;s excess</p>
<p>Did scarce exceed a Guelf&rsquo;s or Ghibelline&rsquo;s</p>
<p class='indent2'>In any special actual righteousness</p>
<p>Of what that day he granted, still the signs</p>
<p class='indent2'>Are good and full of promise, we must say,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>When multitudes approach their kings with prayers</p>
<p class='indent2'>And kings concede their people&rsquo;s right to pray</p>
<p>Both in one sunshine. Griefs are not despairs,</p>
<p class='indent2'>So uttered, nor can royal claims dismay</p>
<p>When men from humble homes and ducal chairs</p>
<p class='indent2'>Hate wrong together. It was well to view</p>
<p>Those banners ruffled in a ruler&rsquo;s face</p>
<p class='indent2'>Inscribed, &ldquo;Live freedom, union, and all true</p>
<p>Brave patriots who are aided by God&rsquo;s grace!&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Nor was it ill when Leopoldo drew</p>
<p>His little children to the window-place</p>
<p class='indent2'>He stood in at the Pitti, to suggest</p>
<p><i>They</i> too should govern as the people willed.</p>
<p class='indent2'>What a cry rose then! some, who saw the best,</p>
<p>Declared his eyes filled up and overfilled</p>
<p class='indent2'>With good warm human tears which unrepressed</p>
<p>Ran down. I like his face; the forehead&rsquo;s build</p>
<p class='indent2'>Has no capacious genius, yet perhaps</p>
<p>Sufficient comprehension,&mdash;mild and sad,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And careful nobly,&mdash;not with care that wraps</p>
<p>Self-loving hearts, to stifle and make mad,</p>
<p class='indent2'>But careful with the care that shuns a lapse</p>
<p>Of faith and duty, studious not to add</p>
<p class='indent2'>A burden in the gathering of a gain.</p>
<p>And so, God save the Duke, I say with those</p>
<p class='indent2'>Who that day shouted it; and while dukes reign,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>May all wear in the visible overflows</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of spirit, such a look of careful pain!</p>
<p>For God must love it better than repose.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And all the people who went up to let</p>
<p class='indent2'>Their hearts out to that Duke, as has been told&mdash;</p>

<p>Their banners?</p>

<p>Superbly calm, as all opposing things,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Slain with the Gorgon, were no more abhorred</p>
<p>Since ended?</p>
<p class='indent16'>No, the people sought no wings</p>
<p class='indent2'>From Perseus in the Loggia, nor implored</p>
<p>An inspiration in the place beside</p>
<p class='indent2'>From that dim bust of Brutus, jagged and grand,</p>

<p class='indent2'>From out the close-clenched marble to demand</p>
<p>The head of Rome&rsquo;s sublimest homicide,</p>

<p class='indent2'>Nor there! the people chose still holier ground:</p>

<p class='indent2'>Which every given heretic you hate,</p>

<p class='indent2'>A pope must hold by popes a little,&mdash;yes,</p>
<p>By councils, from Nic&aelig;a up to Trent,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>By hierocratic empire, more or less</p>
<p>Irresponsible to men,&mdash;he must resent</p>
<p class='indent2'>Each man&rsquo;s particular conscience, and repress</p>
<p>Inquiry, meditation, argument,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As tyrants faction. Also, he must not</p>
<p>Love truth too dangerously, but prefer</p>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;The interests of the Church&rdquo; (because a blot</p>
<p>Is better than a rent, in miniver)&mdash;</p>

<p class='indent2'>Attesting with his pastoral ring and staff</p>
<p>To such a picture of our Lady, hit</p>
<p class='indent2'>Off well by artist-angels (though not half</p>
<p>As fair as Giotto would have painted it)&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>To such a vial, where a dead man&rsquo;s blood</p>
<p>Runs yearly warm beneath a churchman&rsquo;s finger,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>To such a holy house of stone and wood,</p>
<p>Whereof a cloud of angels was the bringer</p>
<p class='indent2'>From Bethlehem to Loreto. Were it good</p>
<p>For any pope on earth to be a flinger</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of stones against these high-niched counterfeits?</p>
<p>Apostates only are iconoclasts.</p>
<p class='indent2'>He dares not say, while this false thing abets</p>
<p>That true thing, &ldquo;This is false.&rdquo; He keeps his fasts</p>
<p class='indent2'>And prayers, as prayer and fast were silver frets</p>
<p>To change a note upon a string that lasts,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And make a lie a virtue. Now, if he</p>
<p>Did more than this, higher hoped, and braver dared,</p>
<p class='indent2'>I think he were a pope in jeopardy,</p>
<p>Or no pope rather, for his truth had barred</p>
<p class='indent2'>The vaulting of his life,&mdash;and certainly,</p>
<p>If he do only this, mankind&rsquo;s regard</p>
<p class='indent2'>Moves on from him at once, to seek some new</p>
<p>Teacher and leader. He is good and great</p>
<p class='indent2'>According to the deeds a pope can do;</p>
<p>Most liberal, save those bonds; affectionate,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As princes may be, and, as priests are, true;</p>
<p>But only the Ninth Pius after eight,</p>
<p class='indent2'>When all&rsquo;s praised most. At best and hopefullest,</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pope&mdash;we want a man! his heart beats warm,</p>
<p class='indent2'>But, like the prince enchanted to the waist,</p>
<p>He sits in stone and hardens by a charm</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Into the marble of his throne high-placed.</p>
<p>Mild benediction waves his saintly arm&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>So, good! but what we want&rsquo;s a perfect man,</p>
<p>Complete and all alive: half travertine</p>
<p class='indent2'>Half suits our need, and ill subserves our plan.</p>
<p>Feet, knees, nerves, sinews, energies divine</p>
<p class='indent2'>Were never yet too much for men who ran</p>
<p>In such hard ways as must be this of thine,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Deliverer whom we seek, whoe&rsquo;er thou art,</p>
<p>Pope, prince, or peasant! If, indeed, the first,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The noblest, therefore! since the heroic heart</p>
<p>Within thee must be great enough to burst</p>
<p class='indent2'>Those trammels buckling to the baser part</p>
<p>Thy saintly peers in Rome, who crossed and cursed</p>
<p class='indent2'>With the same finger.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<p class='indent2'>To meet the sun upon the highest ground.</p>
<p>Take voice and work! we wait to hear thee knock</p>
<p class='indent2'>At some one of our Florentine nine gates,</p>
<p>On each of which was imaged a sublime</p>

<p>As heroes turned their shields in antique time</p>
<p class='indent2'>Emblazoned with honourable acts. And though</p>
<p>The gates are blank now of such images,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And Petrarch looks no more from Nicolo</p>
<p>Toward dear Arezzo, &rsquo;twixt the acacia-trees,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Nor Dante, from gate Gallo&mdash;still we know,</p>
<p>Despite the razing of the blazonries,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Remains the consecration of the shield:</p>
<p>The dead heroic faces will start out</p>
<p class='indent2'>On all these gates, if foes should take the field,</p>
<p>And blend sublimely, at the earliest shout,</p>
<p class='indent2'>With living heroes who will scorn to yield</p>
<p>A hair&rsquo;s-breadth even, when, gazing round about,</p>
<p class='indent2'>They find in what a glorious company</p>
<p>They fight the foes of Florence. Who will grudge</p>
<p class='indent2'>His one poor life, when that great man we see</p>
<p>Has given five hundred years, the world being judge,</p>
<p class='indent2'>To help the glory of his Italy?</p>
<p>Who, born the fair side of the Alps, will budge,</p>
<p class='indent2'>When Dante stays, when Ariosto stays,</p>
<p>When Petrarch stays for ever? Ye bring swords,</p>
<p class='indent2'>My Tuscans? Ay, if wanted in this haze,</p>
<p>Bring swords: but first bring souls!&mdash;bring thoughts and words,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Unrusted by a tear of yesterday&rsquo;s,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Yet awful by its wrong,&mdash;and cut these cords,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And mow this green lush falseness to the roots,</p>
<p>And shut the mouth of hell below the swathe!</p>
<p class='indent2'>And, if ye can bring songs too, let the lute&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Recoverable music softly bathe</p>
<p class='indent2'>Some poet&rsquo;s hand, that, through all bursts and bruits</p>
<p>Of popular passion, all unripe and rathe</p>
<p class='indent2'>Convictions of the popular intellect,</p>
<p>Ye may not lack a finger up the air,</p>

<p class='indent2'>The whiteness of its wings when (sorely pecked</p>
<p>By falcons on your wrists) it unaware</p>
<p class='indent2'>Arose up overhead and out of sight.</p>

<p>Her loins with Charlemagne&rsquo;s sword when foes beset</p>

<p>And Vallombrosa, we two went to see</p>
<p class='indent2'>Last June, beloved companion,&mdash;where sublime</p>
<p>The mountains live in holy families,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And the slow pinewoods ever climb and climb</p>
<p>Half up their breasts, just stagger as they seize</p>
<p class='indent2'>Some grey crag, drop back with it many a time,</p>
<p>And straggle blindly down the precipice.</p>
<p class='indent2'>The Vallombrosan brooks were strewn as thick</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>That June-day, knee-deep with dead beechen leaves,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As Milton saw them ere his heart grew sick</p>
<p>And his eyes blind. I think the monks and beeves</p>
<p class='indent2'>Are all the same too: scarce have they changed the wick</p>
<p>On good Saint Gualbert&rsquo;s altar which receives</p>
<p class='indent2'>The convent&rsquo;s pilgrims; and the pool in front</p>
<p>(Wherein the hill-stream trout are cast, to wait</p>
<p class='indent2'>The beatific vision and the grunt</p>
<p>Used at refectory) keeps its weedy state,</p>
<p class='indent2'>To baffle saintly abbots who would count</p>
<p>The fish across their breviary nor &rsquo;bate</p>
<p class='indent2'>The measure of their steps. O waterfalls</p>
<p>And forests! sound and silence! mountains bare</p>
<p class='indent2'>That leap up peak by peak and catch the palls</p>
<p>Of purple and silver mist to rend and share</p>
<p class='indent2'>With one another, at electric calls</p>
<p>Of life in the sunbeams,&mdash;till we cannot dare</p>
<p class='indent2'>Fix your shapes, count your number! we must think</p>
<p>Your beauty and your glory helped to fill</p>
<p class='indent2'>The cup of Milton&rsquo;s soul so to the brink,</p>
<p>He never more was thirsty when God&rsquo;s will</p>
<p class='indent2'>Had shattered to his sense the last chain-link</p>
<p>By which he had drawn from Nature&rsquo;s visible</p>
<p class='indent2'>The fresh well-water. Satisfied by this,</p>
<p>He sang of Adam&rsquo;s paradise and smiled,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Remembering Vallombrosa. Therefore is</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>The place divine to English man and child,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And pilgrims leave their souls here in a kiss.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<p class='indent2'>With coins of scholars&rsquo; fancy, which, being rung</p>
<p>On work-day counter, still sound silver-proof;</p>
<p class='indent2'>In short, with all the dreams of dreamers young,</p>
<p>Before their heads have time for slipping off</p>
<p class='indent2'>Hope&rsquo;s pillow to the ground. How oft, indeed,</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve sent our souls out from the rigid north,</p>
<p class='indent2'>On bare white feet which would not print nor bleed,</p>
<p>To climb the Alpine passes and look forth,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Where booming low the Lombard rivers lead</p>
<p>To gardens, vineyards, all a dream is worth,&mdash;</p>

<p>Who loved, in brief, the classic hill and brook,</p>

<p class='indent2'>That final gun-flash from Palermo&rsquo;s coast</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>Which lightens their apocalypse of death.</p>
<p class='indent2'>So let them die! The world shows nothing lost;</p>
<p>Therefore, not blood. Above or underneath,</p>
<p class='indent2'>What matter, brothers, if ye keep your post</p>
<p>On duty&rsquo;s side? As sword returns to sheath,</p>
<p class='indent2'>So dust to grave, but souls find place in Heaven.</p>
<p>Heroic daring is the true success,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The eucharistic bread requires no leaven;</p>
<p>And though your ends were hopeless, we should bless</p>
<p class='indent2'>Your cause as holy. Strive&mdash;and, having striven,</p>
<p>Take, for God&rsquo;s recompense, that righteousness!</p>

<p class='indent2'>How marched the civic guard, and stopped to stare</p>
<p>When boys broke windows in a civic glow!</p>
<p class='indent2'>How rebel songs were sung to loyal tunes,</p>
<p>And bishops cursed in ecclesiastic metres:</p>
<p class='indent2'>How all the Circoli grew large as moons,</p>
<p>And all the speakers, moonstruck,&mdash;thankful greeters</p>

<p>How Liberals vowed to burn their palaces,</p>

<p>How grown men raged at Austria&rsquo;s wickedness,</p>

<p class='indent2'>You say we failed in duty, we who wore</p>
<p>Black velvet like Italian democrats,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Who slashed our sleeves like patriots, nor forswore</p>
<p>The true republic in the form of hats?</p>
<p class='indent2'>We chased the archbishop from the Duomo door,</p>
<p>We chalked the walls with bloody caveats</p>
<p class='indent2'>Against all tyrants. If we did not fight</p>

<p class='indent2'>To show that victory was ours of right.</p>
<p>We met, had free discussion everywhere</p>
<p class='indent2'>(Except perhaps i&rsquo; the Chambers) day and night.</p>
<p>We proved the poor should be employed, ... that&rsquo;s fair,&mdash;</p>

<p>Pay certified, yet payers abrogated,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Full work secured, yet liabilities</p>
<p>To overwork excluded,&mdash;not one bated</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of all our holidays, that still, at twice</p>
<p>Or thrice a week, are moderately rated.</p>
<p class='indent2'>We proved that Austria was dislodged, or would</p>
<p>Or should be, and that Tuscany in arms</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Should, would dislodge her, ending the old feud;</p>
<p>And yet, to leave our piazzas, shops, and farms,</p>
<p class='indent2'>For the simple sake of fighting, was not good&mdash;</p>
<p>We proved that also. &ldquo;Did we carry charms</p>
<p class='indent2'>Against being killed ourselves, that we should rush</p>
<p>On killing others? what, desert herewith</p>
<p class='indent2'>Our wives and mothers?&mdash;was that duty? tush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which we shook the sword within the sheath</p>
<p class='indent2'>Like heroes&mdash;only louder; and the flush</p>
<p>Ran up the cheek to meet the future wreath.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Nay, what we proved, we shouted&mdash;how we shouted</p>
<p>(Especially the boys did), boldly planting</p>
<p class='indent2'>That tree of liberty, whose fruit is doubted,</p>
<p>Because the roots are not of nature&rsquo;s granting!</p>
<p class='indent2'>A tree of good and evil: none, without it,</p>
<p>Grow gods; alas and, with it, men are wanting!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<p>O holy rights of nations! If I speak</p>
<p class='indent2'>These bitter things against the jugglery</p>

<p class='indent2'>It is that tears are bitter. When we see</p>
<p>The brown skulls grin at death in churchyards bleak,</p>
<p class='indent2'>We do not cry &ldquo;This Yorick is too light,&rdquo;</p>
<p>For death grows deathlier with that mouth he makes.</p>
<p class='indent2'>So with my mocking: bitter things I write</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>

<p class='indent30'>Men who might</p>
<p>Do greatly in a universe that breaks</p>

<p>Courage and patience are but sacrifice;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And sacrifice is offered for and to</p>
<p>Something conceived of. Each man pays a price</p>
<p class='indent2'>For what himself counts precious, whether true</p>
<p>Or false the appreciation it implies.</p>
<p class='indent2'>But here,&mdash;no knowledge, no conception, nought!</p>
<p>Desire was absent, that provides great deeds</p>
<p class='indent2'>From out the greatness of prevenient thought:</p>
<p>And action, action, like a flame that needs</p>
<p class='indent2'>A steady breath and fuel, being caught</p>
<p>Up, like a burning reed from other reeds,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Flashed in the empty and uncertain air,</p>
<p>Then wavered, then went out. Behold, who blames</p>
<p class='indent2'>A crooked course, when not a goal is there</p>
<p>To round the fervid striving of the games?</p>
<p class='indent2'>An ignorance of means may minister</p>
<p>To greatness, but an ignorance of aims</p>
<p class='indent2'>Makes it impossible to be great at all.</p>

<p>I tell you rather that, whoever may</p>
<p class='indent2'>Discern true ends here, shall grow pure enough</p>
<p>To love them, brave enough to strive for them,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And strong to reach them though the roads be rough:</p>
<p>That having learnt&mdash;by no mere apophthegm&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Not just the draping of a graceful stuff</p>
<p>About a statue, broidered at the hem,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Not just the trilling on an opera-stage</p>
<p>Of &ldquo;libertà&rdquo; to bravos&mdash;(a fair word,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Yet too allied to inarticulate rage</p>
<p>And breathless sobs, for singing, though the chord</p>
<p class='indent2'>Were deeper than they struck it) but the gauge</p>
<p>Of civil wants sustained and wrongs abhorred,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The serious sacred meaning and full use</p>
<p>Of freedom for a nation,&mdash;then, indeed,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Our Tuscans, underneath the bloody dews</p>
<p>Of some new morning, rising up agreed</p>

<p class='indent2'>The Duke&rsquo;s arms, doff your Phrygian caps, and men</p>
<p>The pavement of the piazzas broke into</p>

<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;Here trees of liberty grew yesterday!&rdquo;</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>

<p class='indent2'>To stretch the franchise through their utmost ranks?</p>
<p>That having, like a father, apprehended,</p>
<p class='indent2'>He came to pardon fatherly those pranks</p>
<p>Played out and now in filial service ended?&mdash;</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>From Casa Guidi windows gazing, then,</p>
<p>I saw and witness how the Duke came back.</p>
<p class='indent2'>The regular tramp of horse and tread of men</p>
<p>Did smite the silence like an anvil black</p>
<p class='indent2'>And sparkless. With her wide eyes at full strain,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>Our Tuscan nurse exclaimed &ldquo;Alack, alack,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Signora! these shall be the Austrians.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,</p>
<p>Be still,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;do not wake the child!&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent2'>&mdash;For so, my two-months&rsquo; baby sleeping lay</p>
<p>In milky dreams upon the bed and smiled,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And I thought &ldquo;He shall sleep on, while he may,</p>
<p>Through the world&rsquo;s baseness: not being yet defiled,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Why should he be disturbed by what is done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, gazing, I beheld the long-drawn street</p>
<p class='indent2'>Live out, from end to end, full in the sun,</p>
<p>With Austria&rsquo;s thousand; sword and bayonet,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Horse, foot, artillery,&mdash;cannons rolling on</p>
<p>Like blind slow storm-clouds gestant with the heat</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of undeveloped lightnings, each bestrode</p>
<p>By a single man, dust-white from head to heel,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Indifferent as the dreadful thing he rode,</p>
<p>Like a sculptured Fate serene and terrible.</p>
<p class='indent2'>As some smooth river which has overflowed</p>
<p>Will slow and silent down its current wheel</p>
<p class='indent2'>A loosened forest, all the pines erect,</p>
<p>So swept, in mute significance of storm,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The marshalled thousands; not an eye deflect</p>
<p>To left or right, to catch a novel form</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of Florence city adorned by architect</p>
<p>And carver, or of Beauties live and warm</p>
<p class='indent2'>Scared at the casements,&mdash;all, straightforward eyes</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>

<p class='indent2'>Resuscitated monarchs disentomb</p>

<p class='indent2'>Meanwhile, from Casa Guidi windows, we</p>

<p class='indent2'>Into the drowning heart of Tuscany:</p>

<p class='indent2'>They wept and cursed in silence. Silently</p>
<p>Our noisy Tuscans watched the invading foe;</p>
<p class='indent2'>They had learnt silence. Pressed against the wall,</p>
<p>And grouped upon the church-steps opposite,</p>
<p class='indent2'>A few pale men and women stared at all.</p>
<p>God knows what they were feeling, with their white</p>
<p class='indent2'>Constrainèd faces, they, so prodigal</p>
<p>Of cry and gesture when the world goes right,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Or wrong indeed. But here was depth of wrong,</p>
<p>And here, still water; they were silent here;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And through that sentient silence, struck along</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>That measured tramp from which it stood out clear,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Distinct the sound and silence, like a gong</p>
<p>At midnight, each by the other awfuller,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>While every soldier in his cap displayed</p>
<p>A leaf of olive. Dusty, bitter thing!</p>
<p class='indent2'>Was such plucked at Novara, is it said?</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>A cry is up in England, which doth ring</p>

<p>I, too, have loved peace, and from bole to bole</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of immemorial undeciduous trees</p>
<p>Would write, as lovers use upon a scroll,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The holy name of Peace and set it high</p>
<p>Where none could pluck it down. On trees, I say,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Not upon gibbets!&mdash;With the greenery</p>
<p>Of dewy branches and the flowery May,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sweet mediation betwixt earth and sky</p>
<p>Providing, for the shepherd&rsquo;s holiday.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Not upon gibbets! though the vulture leaves</p>
<p>The bones to quiet, which he first picked bare.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Not upon dungeons! though the wretch who grieves</p>
<p>And groans within less stirs the outer air</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p class='indent2'>Than any little field-mouse stirs the sheaves.</p>
<p>Not upon chain-bolts! though the slave&rsquo;s despair</p>

<p>And left him blank beneath the freeman&rsquo;s whip</p>
<p class='indent2'>To sing and laugh out idiocies of pain.</p>
<p>Nor yet on starving homes! where many a lip</p>
<p class='indent2'>Has sobbed itself asleep through curses vain.</p>
<p>I love no peace which is not fellowship</p>
<p class='indent2'>And which includes not mercy. I would have</p>
<p>Rather the raking of the guns across</p>
<p class='indent2'>The world, and shrieks against Heaven&rsquo;s architrave;</p>
<p>Rather the struggle in the slippery fosse</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of dying men and horses, and the wave</p>
<p>Blood-bubbling.... Enough said!&mdash;by Christ&rsquo;s own cross,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And by this faint heart of my womanhood,</p>
<p>Such things are better than a Peace that sits</p>
<p class='indent2'>Beside a hearth in self-commended mood,</p>
<p>And takes no thought how wind and rain by fits</p>
<p class='indent2'>Are howling out of doors against the good</p>

<p class='indent2'>Like any vulgar throne the nations lop</p>
<p>To pieces for their firewood unreclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And, when it burns too, we shall see as well</p>
<p>In Italy as elsewhere. Let it burn.</p>
<p class='indent2'>The cross, accounted still adorable,</p>
<p>Is Christ&rsquo;s cross only!&mdash;if the thief&rsquo;s would earn</p>
<p class='indent2'>Some stealthy genuflexions, we rebel;</p>
<p>And here the impenitent thief&rsquo;s has had its turn,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As God knows; and the people on their knees</p>
<p>Scoff and toss back the crosiers stretched like yokes</p>
<p class='indent2'>To press their heads down lower by degrees.</p>
<p>So Italy, by means of these last strokes,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Escapes the danger which preceded these,</p>
<p>Of leaving captured hands in cloven oaks,&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of leaving very souls within the buckle</p>
<p>Whence bodies struggled outward,&mdash;of supposing</p>
<p class='indent2'>That freemen may like bondsmen kneel and truckle,</p>
<p>And then stand up as usual, without losing</p>
<p class='indent2'>An inch of stature.</p>
<p class='indent22'>Those whom she-wolves suckle</p>

<p class='indent2'>But not cast lots for. The last chrism, poured right,</p>
<p>Was on that Head, and poured for burial</p>
<p class='indent2'>And not for domination in men&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p>What <i>are</i> these churches? The old temple-wall</p>
<p class='indent2'>Doth overlook them juggling with the sleight</p>
<p>Of surplice, candlestick and altar-pall;</p>
<p class='indent2'>East church and west church, ay, north church and south,</p>
<p>Rome&rsquo;s church and England&rsquo;s,&mdash;let them all repent,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And make concordats &rsquo;twixt their soul and mouth,</p>
<p>Succeed Saint Paul by working at the tent,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Become infallible guides by speaking truth,</p>
<p>And excommunicate their pride that bent</p>
<p class='indent2'>And cramped the souls of men.</p>
<p class='indent32'>Why, even here</p>
<p>Priestcraft burns out, the twinèd linen blazes;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Not, like asbestos, to grow white and clear,</p>
<p>But all to perish!&mdash;while the fire-smell raises</p>
<p class='indent2'>To life some swooning spirits who, last year,</p>
<p>Lost breath and heart in these church-stifled places.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Why, almost, through this Pius, we believed</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>The priesthood could be an honest thing, he smiled</p>
<p class='indent2'>So saintly while our corn was being sheaved</p>
<p>For his own granaries! Showing now defiled</p>
<p class='indent2'>His hireling hands, a better help&rsquo;s achieved</p>
<p>Than if they blessed us shepherd-like and mild.</p>
<p class='indent2'>False doctrine, strangled by its own amen,</p>

<p>Which was not also holy, yet did come</p>
<p class='indent2'>&rsquo;Twixt sacramental actions,&mdash;brotherhood</p>
<p>Despised even there, and something of the doom</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of Remus in the trenches. Listen now&mdash;</p>
<p>Rossi died silent near where C&aelig;sar died.</p>
<p class='indent2'>HE did not say &ldquo;My Brutus, is it thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Italy unquestioned testified</p>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;<i>I</i> killed him! <i>I</i> am Brutus.&mdash;I avow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which the whole world&rsquo;s laugh of scorn replied</p>
<p class='indent2'>&ldquo;A poor maimed copy of Brutus!&rdquo;</p>
<p class='indent34'>Too much like,</p>

<p>To be so skilful where a man is killed</p>
<p class='indent2'>Near Pompey&rsquo;s statue, and the daggers strike</p>
<p>At unawares i&rsquo; the throat. Was thus fulfilled</p>
<p class='indent2'>An omen once of Michel Angelo?&mdash;</p>
<p>When Marcus Brutus he conceived complete,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And strove to hurl him out by blow on blow</p>
<p>Upon the marble, at Art&rsquo;s thunderheat,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Till haply (some pre-shadow rising slow</p>
<p>Of what his Italy would fancy meet</p>
<p class='indent2'>To be called <span class='smcap'>Brutus</span>) straight his plastic hand</p>
<p>Fell back before his prophet-soul, and left</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
</div>
<p>These poems were written under the pressure of the events
they indicate, after a residence in Italy of so many years that
the present triumph of great principles is heightened to the
writer&rsquo;s feelings by the disastrous issue of the last movement,
witnessed from &ldquo;Casa Guidi Windows&rdquo; in 1849. Yet, if the
verses should appear to English readers too pungently rendered
to admit of a patriotic respect to the English sense of
things, I will not excuse myself on such grounds, nor on the
ground of my attachment to the Italian people and my admiration
of their heroic constancy and union. What I have
written has simply been written because I love truth and
justice <i>quand même</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;more than Plato&rdquo; and Plato&rsquo;s country,
more than Dante and Dante&rsquo;s country, more even than
Shakespeare and Shakespeare&rsquo;s country.</p>
<p>And if patriotism means the flattery of one&rsquo;s nation in
every case, then the patriot, take it as you please, is merely
the courtier which I am not, though I have written &ldquo;Napoleon
III. in Italy.&rdquo; It is time to limit the significance of
certain terms, or to enlarge the significance of certain things.
Nationality is excellent in its place; and the instinct of self-love
is the root of a man, which will develop into sacrificial
virtues. But all the virtues are means and uses; and, if we
hinder their tendency to growth and expansion, we both
destroy them as virtues, and degrade them to that rankest
species of corruption reserved for the most noble organizations.
For instance,&mdash;non-intervention in the affairs of
neighbouring states is a high political virtue; but non-intervention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
does not mean, passing by on the other side when
your neighbour falls among thieves,&mdash;or Phariseeism would
recover it from Christianity. Freedom itself is virtue, as
well as privilege; but freedom of the seas does not mean
piracy, nor freedom of the land, brigandage; nor freedom of
the senate, freedom to cudgel a dissident member; nor freedom
of the press, freedom to calumniate and lie. So, if
patriotism be a virtue indeed, it cannot mean an exclusive
devotion to our country&rsquo;s interests,&mdash;for that is only another
form of devotion to personal interests, family interests, or
provincial interests, all of which, if not driven past themselves,
are vulgar and immoral objects. Let us put away
the Little Peddlingtonism unworthy of a great nation, and
too prevalent among us. If the man who does not look
beyond this natural life is of a somewhat narrow order, what
must be the man who does not look beyond his own frontier
or his own sea?</p>
<p>I confess that I dream of the day when an English statesman
shall arise with a heart too large for England; having
courage in the face of his countrymen to assert of some suggested
policy,&mdash;&ldquo;This is good for your trade; this is
necessary for your domination: but it will vex a people hard
by; it will hurt a people farther off; it will profit nothing to
the general humanity: therefore, away with it!&mdash;it is not for
you or for me.&rdquo; When a British minister dares speak so,
and when a British public applauds him speaking, then
shall the nation be glorious, and her praise, instead of exploding
from within, from loud civic mouths, come to her
from without, as all worthy praise must, from the alliances
she has fostered and the populations she has saved.</p>
<p>And poets who write of the events of that time shall not
need to justify themselves in prefaces for ever so little jarring
of the national sentiment imputable to their rhymes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; I answered once again.</p>

<p>These Poems are given as they occur on a list drawn up
last June. A few had already been printed in periodicals.</p>
<p>There is hardly such direct warrant for publishing the
Translations; which were only intended, many years ago,
to accompany and explain certain Engravings after ancient
Gems, in the projected work of a friend, by whose kindness
they are now recovered: but as two of the original series
(the &ldquo;Adonis&rdquo; of Bion and &ldquo;Song to the Rose&rdquo; from Achilles
Tatius) have subsequently appeared, it is presumed that the
remainder may not improperly follow.</p>
<p>A single recent version is added.</p>

<p>These famous statues recline in the Sagrestia Nuova, on the
tombs of Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici, third son of Lorenzo the Magnificent,
and Lorenzo of Urbino, his grandson. Strozzi&rsquo;s epigram on the Night,
with Michel Angelo&rsquo;s rejoinder, is well known.</p>

<p>Savonarola was burnt for his testimony against papal corruptions
as early as March, 1498: and, as late as our own day, it has been
a custom in Florence to strew with violets the pavement where he
suffered, in grateful recognition of the anniversary.</p>

<p>Charles of Anjou, in his passage through Florence, was permitted
to see this picture while yet in Cimabue&rsquo;s &ldquo;bottega.&rdquo; The populace
followed the royal visitor, and, from the universal delight and admiration,
the quarter of the city in which the artist lived was called &ldquo;Borgo
Allegri.&rdquo; The picture was carried in triumph to the church, and deposited
there.</p>

<p>How Cimabue found Giotto, the shepherd-boy, sketching a ram
of his flock upon a stone, is prettily told by Vasari,&mdash;who also relates
that the elder artist Margheritone died &ldquo;infastidito&rdquo; of the successes
of the new school.</p>

<p>The Florentines, to whom the Ravennese refused the body of
Dante (demanded of them &ldquo;in a late remorse of love&rdquo;), have given a
cenotaph in this church to their divine poet. Something less than a
grave!</p>

<p>Philostratus relates of Apollonius how he objected to the musical
instrument of Linus the Rhodian that it could not enrich or beautify.
The history of music in our day would satisfy the philosopher on one
